# First steps with R in Life Sciences

This course material is part of the "First Steps with R in Life Science" two-day course of [SIB Training](https://www.sib.swiss/training/upcoming-training-courses) and is 
 addressed to beginners wanting to become familiar with the R syntax, environment, and the most common commands to start using R to explore and interpret their data.

This course material provides an introduction to [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) (an integrated development environment for R) in an interactive manner. 
It contains example data-sets to practise data manipulation, graphical exploration and statistical hypothesis testing.

## prerequisite installation

To follow this course, make sure you have [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) installed beforehand.

## course material organization

The course material is organized in parts corresponding to the 2 days of the course.

The slides provided contain both theory and hands-on practice session instructions. 

The data used in the practicals can be found in the data [`course_datasets/`](course_datasets/) folder, and
solutions codes can be found in the [`solutions/`](solutions/) folder (NB: practise session 1 and 2 do not have associated code).

 * [Day 1 slides](slides/First-steps-with-R_day1.pdf) covers the most basic aspects
 	* first contact with the language and software
 	* most common data types in R
 	* reading and writing data files with R
 * [Day 2 - morning slides](slides/First-steps-with-R_day2_morning.pdf) discusses visualization in R and how to create and customize simple, yet efficient, graphics from your data
 * [Day 2 - afternoon slides](slides/First-steps-with-R_day2_afternoon.pdf) introduces how to perform statistical analysis in R (be warned: this is not a statistics course and only aims to show how the language deals with it)
