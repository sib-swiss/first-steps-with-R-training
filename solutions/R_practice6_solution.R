# First Steps in R, Practice 6

#A dataset from mice experiments at 18 weeks is available in the file mice_data_mod.csv
# (courtesy of F Schutz and F. Preitner). Let's explore a bit the dataset to see what it contains.

# 1) Open a new script file in R studio, comment it and save it.

# 2) Have look at the csv file in R studio's file explorer. What do you need to check in order to be able to read in the file correctly?

# file > open ...
# By looking at the file, we can see there is a header, and the separator between fields is ",".
# There are no row names.

# 3) Read the file, assign it to object "mice_data". Examine the object.

getwd() # check where you are. If you didn't change anything, you will be in the folder with the .Rproj file (rpoject root)


# If you are not at your project root, set the directory to where you want to be
# for example : setwd("D:/docs/R_Oct2020_exercises_live")

mice_data <- read.table( "course_datasets/mice_data.csv" , header=TRUE , sep="," )
mice_data <- read.csv( "course_datasets/mice_data.csv")
# read in data with header and , separator

# 4) How many observations and variables does the dataset have?
D <- dim(mice_data)
D[1] #number of observations.
D[2] #number of variables.

# alternatively:
nrow(mice_data)
ncol(mice_data)


# 5) What is the structure of the dataset?
str(mice_data)

# What are the names and classes of the variables?
#'data.frame':	50 obs. of  3 variables:
# $ diet    : chr  "HFD" "HFD" "HFD" "HFD" ...
# $ genotype: chr  "WT" "WT" "WT" "WT" ...
# $ weight  : num  31.2 32.1 30.3 45 39.2 38.8 41.8 46.2 35.8 35.4 ...

# 6) Which variables appear to be categorical? Convert them to factors.
mice_data$diet <- factor(mice_data$diet)
mice_data$genotype <- factor(mice_data$genotype)

# 7) Get the summary statistics of  "mice_data"
summary(mice_data)

# 8) Use the function table() to compute the number of observations in different mouse groups. a) How many mice are included of each genotype (WT, KO)? b) How many mice are included per diet (HFD, CHOW)? c) Make a 2x2 table by genotype and diet crossed.

table(mice_data$genotype)# by genotype (WT/KO)
table(mice_data$diet)# by diet (CHOW/HFD)

table(mice_data$genotype, mice_data$diet ) # table crossing both



# 9) Isolate the observations for the mice on high fat diet (HFD) using subset(). Compute a summary statistics just for the weights of the subset. Then do the same for the mice on regular chow diet (CHOW). Export the data of each subgroup to a csv file.

mice_data_HFD <- subset(mice_data , diet == "HFD") # OR, mice_data[ mice_data$diet == "HFD",]
summary(mice_data_HFD$weight)
write.csv(mice_data_HFD,"mice_data_HFD.csv",row.names=FALSE,quote=FALSE)

mice_data_CHOW <- subset(mice_data, diet == "CHOW")
summary(mice_data_CHOW$weight)
write.csv(mice_data_CHOW, "mice_data_CHOW.csv", row.names=FALSE,quote=F)

#10) Look at the results from the two previous exercises. What does this initial exploration of the data suggest about mouse weights?

# Genotype (KO v WT) does not seem to have a big effect on mouse weight.
# Mice on HFD are heavier on average than mice on CHOW diet, and their weights are more variable.

# Open question, not explored yet: Is the diet effect on weight influenced by the genotype? I.e., do KO and WT mice respond differently to HFD?



# 11) Optional: Compute means and standard deviations for WT and KO mouse weights using tapply(). Then do the same for CHOW and HFD mice. Then do it for diet/genotype combinations.

tapply(mice_data$weight, mice_data$genotype, mean)# mean: by genotype (WT/KO)
tapply(mice_data$weight, mice_data$genotype, sd)# by genotype (WT/KO)

tapply(mice_data$weight, mice_data$diet, mean)# by diet (CHOW/HFD)
tapply(mice_data$weight, mice_data$diet, sd)# sd: by diet (CHOW/HFD)

tapply(mice_data$weight, list(mice_data$genotype, mice_data$diet), mean)# by genotype/diet (CHOW/HFD)
tapply(mice_data$weight, list(mice_data$genotype, mice_data$diet), sd)# sd: by genotype/diet (CHOW/HFD)
